## Fully-Connected NN
#### ITMO Project
The project contains a source code for a Fully-Connected NN that works with svhn dataset. (Well, it will be. Soon)
This NN is hardly depended on my hand-written library (which code is also presented as a source code here)
that implements some operations over matrixes in a NumPy-like style. Matrix.hpp and Matrix.cpp files.
